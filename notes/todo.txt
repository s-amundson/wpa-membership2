ToDo
integrate with wordpress perhaps sub-folder


ineligible for renewal if expire date > 1 year + current date

maybe square payment order status and idempotency_key in pay log and insert pay log id in membership, JOAD Reg, and other tables

fix joad session in registration, check in joad registration.

check if member just added with same credentials before adding. to avoid accidental resubmission.
fix email address with square payment. all transactions getting same email address. - probably same customer in squares system

names with apostrophes need to have the apostrophe escaped

add logic to resend verification email.

add table for comped volunteers. set up so that comped volunteers renewal is free.

member['pay_code'] is not really used. consider changing to renew code

upgrade renewals to allow to edit all family members. Perhaps a link on the family members id opens their reg form.
